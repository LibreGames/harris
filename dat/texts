==beginning==

You have been appointed Commander-in-Chief of RAF Bomber Command.  The Air Ministry have instructed you to employ
 your forces on attacks upon enemy shipping and upon purely military targets; your crews are under standing orders
 not to bomb if there is any danger to civilians, and in particular not to drop their bombs without visual
 identification of the target.

The Air Ministry further reminds you that due to the shortage of industrial capacity, and the lack of trained
 aircrews, losses must be conserved as much as possible.  Nonetheless you are expected to strike against the enemy
 with as much force as these restrictions allow.

You are also notified that the Political Warfare department wishes you to drop their propaganda leaflets
 (Operation "Nickel") over Germany whenever you can spare the forces to do so, in order to sow dissent and
 discontent amongst the German people.

The Navy have asked you to drop mines in strategic sea lanes; such operations are code-named "Gardening".

Your front-line forces consist of the following types:
Bristol Blenheim:
 A light bomber for attacking coastal targets and tactical bombing.  It can't penetrate deep into Germany though.
Armstrong-Whitworth Whitley:
 Designed as a night bomber, the Whitley carries the heaviest load, and has the range to reach Berlin.
Handley Page Hampden:
 A high-performance bomber with good bombing accuracy, the Hampden can reach well beyond the Ruhr.
Vickers Wellington:
 A rugged and reliable all-rounder.  It's just able to reach Berlin with a maximum fuel load.

The Third Reich is known to be operating the following fighter types:
Messerschmitt Bf109:
 A high-performance day-fighter pressed into interceptor service.
Dornier Do17Z:
 A converted bomber with infrared equipment for night-time target finding.

==NORWAY==

The German Navy has assembled a fleet heading north to invade Norway.
You are ordered to blow them out of the water.

The so-called "Phoney War" is over.

==CIV==

In light of the costs of waging the bomber campaign, and of the enemy's clear indication that he intends to
 observe no limits to the conduct of war (as demonstrated by recent events), the restrictions upon bombing in
 civilian areas have been lifted; bombs may be dropped without positive target identification.  However, you are
 still directed to aim your attacks upon military and industrial targets; the War Office does not believe this
 country should engage in the indiscriminate bombing of civilians.

Strategic attacks are to be made upon German industry, with the intention of breaking the economic base of the
 Nazi war machine.  Priority targets include oil refineries, the aircraft and ballbearing industries, steelworks,
 and the huge Krupps armament works at Essen.

Your bombers will also be required to support the battle for France, with attacks on communications and enemy
 troop concentrations.

==BARGE==

The Germans have begun amassing barges in several Continental ports; it appears they are preparing for an
 invasion.  The War Office has ordered you to attack these barges, and prevent the invasion!

==ENDBARGE==

The invasion fleet appears to have been dispersed.  The Germans, defeated in the Battle of Britain, appear to have
 postponed their plans for invasion.  You can now return to the primary objectives.

==LONDON==

Last night, Luftwaffe bombers attacked London.  The Air Ministry urges you to retaliate, and authorises immediate
 attacks on the German capital, Berlin.

==COVENTRY==

After last night's heavy Luftwaffe raids on Coventry, discussions are taking place at the highest level on whether
 Bomber Command should mount retaliatory area raids on German cities.
Until a decision is taken, you are to continue attacking industrial and military targets, as previously.

==MANNHEIM==

The government has decided to authorise Operation Abigail Rachel, an area attack upon the city of Mannheim.
This is to be considered an experiment.

==UBOAT==

Losses in the Battle of the Atlantic are becoming critical.  The Air Ministry has asked you to attack German
 U-boats, in their factories and in the Kiel and Bremerhaven shipyards.

==ABD==

As experience has shown that precision bombing requires much greater accuracy than appears to be attainable, you
 are now directed to pursue the area bombing of cities.  Your attacks should now be focused upon the morale of the
 enemy civil population, and in particular industrial workers.  You are accordingly authorised to employ your
 forces without restriction.

==INV==

As part of the preparations for the invasion of the Continent, you are ordered to attack marshalling yards,
 railways, and airfields.  The area bombing campaign has been suspended; for the next six months you are under the
 direction of General Eisenhower.

==V1==

The Germans have begun to launch pilotless aircraft called "V1" or "FZG76" against London and the ports.  You are
 directed to bomb the launching sites and factories responsible for the supply of these flying bombs.

==DDAY==

Today is D-Day, the Allied invasion of Continental Europe.  Your bomber forces will now be required for army
 co-operation, attacking enemy troop concentrations and vital transport links.

==V1END==

The invasion forces have now reached far enough into Europe that Britain is no longer within range of V1 attack.

==R2AB==

As the Allied forces are now well-established on the Continent, you have been freed from army co-operation duties,
 and can now return to the Area Bombing campaign.

==TERROR==

I have received the following minute from Churchill:
    "It seems to me that the moment has come when the question of bombing of German cities simply for the sake of
     increasing the terror, though under other pretexts, should be reviewed.  I feel the need for more precise
     concentration upon military objectives such as oil and communications behind the immediate battle-zone,
     rather than on mere acts of terror and wanton destruction, however impressive."

==MANNA==

As ground forces have entered Berlin, the war is clearly almost over; you are now directed to cease strategic
 bombing attacks.  Your aircraft are now required for Operation Manna, the supply of food by air to famine-
 stricken regions in the Netherlands.

==VE==

Germany has surrendered!  After six long years, the war in Europe is over.
The bombers' job is done, and the aircrews can stand down at last.

Congratulations!

==BROUGHTON==

As the shadow factory at Broughton is now fully operational, Vickers Wellingtons can now be produced much more
 rapidly and cheaply.  Accordingly, they now cost only £8,000 out of your budget, rather than £12,000.

==PFF==

The Air Ministry have mandated the creation of "Pathfinder Force", a unit drawn from the best crews in the
 command, to mark the targets using radionavigation and the new TI, or "Target Indicator", pyrotechnic flares.

No. 8 Group, led by Air Vice-Marshal Don Bennett, has been formed for this rôle.

==GEE==

A new radionavigation aid, GEE, has been developed.  Using synchronised pulse transmissions from three ground
 stations, it gives aircrews a rough idea of their position, but is insufficiently accurate for blind bombing.

This aid to navigation enables the use of "bomber stream" tactics; from now on, all bombers will follow the same
 route to the target, concentrating the attack to overwhelm enemy ground-controlled interception.

==OBOE==

A blind bombing aid has been developed and is now available for installation into your bombers.  Called OBOE, it
 relies on radio transmissions from ground stations and can only handle a small number of aircraft (about fifteen
 per hour for each pair of ground stations).

==H2S==

A new navigation aid has been developed.  H2S is an air-to-ground radar which enables aircrews to navigate in
 cloud.  Rivers and coastlines give the best 'fixes'.

==GH==

A new blind bombing aid, Gee-H, has been developed.  Based on the OBOE principle, it retains that system's
 accuracy but can be used by several aircraft at the same time.  A pair of ground stations can typically support
 about twenty concurrent users.

==ALLGEE==

GEE sets are now plentiful enough to be installed on the production line in every new bomber.

==BOOZER==

A new radio countermeasure, codenamed "Boozer", is now being installed into your bombers.  It detects the
 emissions of German radar and warns the aircrew when they are being tracked.

==WINDOW==

A new radio countermeasure, codenamed "Window", is ready for introduction.  It consists of strips of metal foil
 which are pushed out of the bombers and which blind the enemy radar.  To obtain maximum mutual protection from
 Window, bombers will henceforth fly together in one big stream.

The War Office advises that the first use is likely to cause extra confusion and disruption to the enemy defences,
 and should thus be on a large-scale raid.

==MOONSHINE==

A new radio countermeasure, codenamed "Moonshine", is now being installed into bomber support aircraft.  It picks
 up German 'Freya' ground radar and sends back delayed echoes, causing a single aircraft to look like a whole
 squadron.  This should reduce losses to nightfighter attack.

==ABC==

A new radio countermeasure is now available.  "Airborne Cigar" operators will use transmitters codenamed "Jostle"
 and "Piperack" to jam enemy radiotelephony frequencies, preventing ground-controlled interception.

==FISHPOND==

A new radio countermeasure is now being installed into your bombers.  "Fishpond" is a modification to the H2S
 receiver that allows it to detect aircraft below and somewhat to either side of the bomber.

==SERRATE==

A new radio countermeasure is now available.  "Serrate" sets will allow our 'Intruder' nightfighters to track
 German nightfighters by the emissions from their Lichtenstein B/C radar.

==WURZBURG==

Intelligence reports suggest that the Germans now have radar equipment for searchlight and intercept control,
 known as "Würzburg".

==KAMMHUBER==

Intelligence reports that the Germans are building a line of flak, searchlights and radar covering the approaches
 to the Continent.

==TAMEBOAR==

Intelligence reports that the Germans are changing their night-fighting tactics.  The new system, "Zahme Sau", is
 reportedly a response to Window.

==L_BC==

Intelligence reports that the enemy have developed an airborne radar set, the Lichtenstein B/C, and are installing
 it in their nightfighters.

==NAXOS==

Intelligence reports that enemy nightfighters are now being equipped with Naxos, a device for homing in on
 emissions from a bomber's H2S set.  Aircrews are advised to use the H2S for as short a time as possible.

==L_SN==

Intelligence reports a new German radar set, the Lichtenstein SN, which can defeat our radio countermeasures.
Enemy nightfighters are likely to increase their kills.

==MUSIK==

Intelligence reports that the Germans are applying a mod known as "Schräge Musik" enabling them to attack our
 bombers from beneath, where they have a blind spot.

==GEEJAM==

The Germans have begun to jam GEE on a large scale; aircrews report that the system becomes unusable shortly after
 crossing the Continental coast.

==FREYA==

Intelligence reports that the German defences are being directed by 'Freya', a coastal radar network.  It is
 believed to operate on a similar principle to our Chain Home.

==V_WEAPONS==

Intelligence reports that the Germans are developing pilotless aircraft, long-range rockets, and other
 "superweapons", at Peenemünde.

==SECRET==

Intelligence reports that the Germans have an undisclosed secret weapon "against which no defence would avail".

==FLAKGAS==

Intelligence reports a new German anti-aircraft weapon, "FLAK GAS", which is alleged to stop the engines of
 aircraft.  No further details are available at this time.

==FRANCE==

Today, the French forces surrendered to Germany at Compiègne.  We now fight alone against the Nazi terror.

In a speech to the House of Commons, Churchill said,
    "…the Battle of France is over.  I expect that the Battle of Britain is about to begin."

==CRETE==

Bad news from the Mediterranean: the island of Crete has surrendered to German troops.  With this defeat, we have
 lost our last remaining positions in the Balkans.

==BARBAROSSA==

The Germans have launched Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union.

==AMERICA==

With the attack today by Japanese aircraft on the American base at Pearl Harbour, the United States has joined
 the war.
In other news, the German offensive against Soviet Russia has stalled.  Although within sight of Moscow, they are
 being rapidly pushed back by the Russian counter-offensive.

==EL_ALAMEIN==

Good news from Egypt, where Lt Gen Montgomery's forces have won a major victory at El Alamein.  The tide of the
 North African campaign appears finally to have turned.
In the words of Churchill,
    "This is not the end; it is not even the beginning of the end.  But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning."

==STALINGRAD==

Good news from the Eastern Front: the Soviet forces have surrounded the city of Stalingrad, trapping approximately
 30,000 German troops.

==KURSK==

The Soviets have won a decisive victory at the Battle of Kursk, and begun the long march to Berlin.  While Germany
 is certainly not defeated yet, an eventual Allied victory finally seems probable.

==Blenheim==

The twin-engined Bristol Blenheim (Bristol Type 142M) was, when introduced in 1937, as fast as contemporary
 fighters.  By the outbreak of war, however, it had already been outclassed by the rapid pace of aeronautical
 development.  This, combined with its poor defensive armament, leave it vulnerable to fighter attack.  As a light
 bomber, it carries a mere 1,200lb of bombs, and hasn't the range to attack distant targets.  It's best employed
 against coastal targets and enemy-held airfields and troop concentrations in France.

==Whitley==

The Armstrong Whitworth A.W.38 Whitley is a twin-engined medium bomber, designed for night operations.  Due to the
 high angle of incidence of the wings (to ensure good takeoff performance), the Whitley flies with a nose-down
 attitude; the resulting high drag makes it rather slow.  However, it can carry a bomb load of about 7,000lb, the
 heaviest of the bombers available to you at the start of the war.  It's best used for mining, leaflet raids, and
 long-range sorties.

==Hampden==

The Handley Page HP.52 Hampden was conceived as a fast, manoeuvrable, "fighting bomber".  It's a twin-engined
 medium bomber, and the fastest of the bombers available in 1939.  Its bomb load of 4,000lb is lighter than the
 other medium bombers, and it's fairly vulnerable to modern fighters.  Consequently, it may struggle to reach
 well-defended targets.  It's a good bombing platform, though, so accuracy is good.

==Wellington==

The Vickers Wellington, popularly dubbed the "Wimpy", is anything but; its geodesic construction allows it to
 withstand terrible damage and continue with the operation.  It's the most survivable, and also the most reliable,
 of the twin-engined medium bombers at the start of the war.  It carries a load of 4,500lb, and is a solid
 all-rounder.

==Manchester==

The Avro 679 Manchester is the first of the heavy bombers to come into service.  It's powered by two Vulture
 engines, which are sadly unreliable and underpowered; as a result, it's likely to suffer losses both from enemy
 action and from mechanical failure.  However, it does carry a decent bomb load of 10,350lb.  It should probably
 be treated as a Whitley replacement.

==NEW_Manchester==

A new type of bomber has been developed and is now going into production.  The Avro Manchester is a twin-engined
 heavy bomber, capable of carrying 50% more bombs than a Whitley.  There have been a few teething problems with
 the Vulture engines, though.

==Stirling==

The Short S.29 Stirling is the first four-engined heavy bomber available.  It's fairly slow with a low ceiling,
 but good manoeuvrability gives it a decent chance of survival.  It carries a heavy 14,000lb load, but isn't great
 for accuracy.  It also has poor reliability and serviceability, and a limited range.  Nonetheless, it's a welcome
 addition to the heavy striking force.

==NEW_Stirling==

The first of the new four-engined heavy bombers is now going into production.  The Short Stirling, a very large
 aircraft, carries a huge 14,000lb of bombs.

==Halifax I==

The Handley Page H.P.57 Halifax I is a four-engined heavy.  Its load of 13,000lb is slightly less than the
 Stirling, and it suffers from a fatal yaw spiral in violent evasive manoeuvres, but it's faster, more reliable,
 and much more serviceable.  It's also a better bombing platform.  It gives you a realistic long-range heavy
 capability.

==NEW_Halifax I==

A new type of bomber has been developed and is now going into production.  The Handley Page Halifax is generally
 an improvement over the Stirling and has a longer range, but it does carry slightly less ordnance.

==Lancaster I==

The Avro 683 Lancaster is the classic heavy bomber.  Developed from the Manchester, but re-engined with four
 Merlins, it carries 14,000lb of bombs, is reliable and survivable, and makes a good bombing platform.  It's a
 great all-round heavy, capable of anything from area bombing cities at night to precision strikes on special
 targets by day.

==NEW_Lancaster I==

A new type of bomber has been developed and is now going into production.  All the signs suggest that the Avro
 Lancaster will prove to be a classic heavy bomber: it's fast, reliable, and well-equipped to survive in the harsh
 night skies of Europe.

==Mosquito==

The de Havilland DH.98 Mosquito is a high-performance, multi-rôle aircraft.  It's made chiefly of wood, making it
 easy to produce; it's extremely fast, reliable, and almost impossible to shoot down.  Although it only carries
 4,000lb of bombs, it's capable of applying them with considerable accuracy.  It's best used as an OBOE-equipped
 Pathfinder, marking targets with pyrotechnics for the heavies to aim at.  It can also make 'nuisance raids' deep
 into enemy territory, keeping the Germans awake and nervous on nights without a major raid, and it's handy for
 diversionary attacks too.  A remarkable aircraft.

==NEW_Mosquito==

A new type of bomber has been developed and is now going into production.  The de Havilland Mosquito is small but
 powerful; its high performance makes it almost invulnerable.  Combined with OBOE, it looks as though it will
 prove to be the perfect Pathfinder aircraft.

==Halifax III==

The H.P.61 Halifax III is an improved Halifax; the yaw spiral has been fixed with a revised tailplane, and the
 bombload increased to 13,500lb.  Though eclipsed by the more famous Lancaster, the "Halibag" is a solid
 workhorse; for one thing, it's cheaper.  It's also easier to maintain, due to its rugged construction.  It can
 prove handy for secondary tasks, such as minelaying and diversionary raids, and it's not a bad bomber...
 it's just not the best.

==NEW_Halifax III==

A new type of bomber has been developed and is now going into production.  The Halifax Mark III is easier to
 produce in quantity, and to maintain, than the Lancaster, but has slightly inferior performance.

==Lancaster X==

The designation "Lancaster B.X" actually refers only to airframes built in Canada by Victory Aircraft Ltd., but in
 Harris it represents all the developed variants of the Lanc.  With more powerful engines and better armament (the
 four .303 Brownings in the tail are replaced with twin .50s), the upgraded Lanc is faster, carries more (16,000lb
 of bombs), is more reliable and survivable - it's simply the ultimate heavy bomber.

==NEW_Lancaster X==

Advanced versions of the Lancaster are now going into production.
These new variants carry more bombs and mount better defensive armament.

==Bf109E==

The main German day-fighter of the Battle of Britain, early raids saw the Messerschmitt Bf109E "Emil" pressed into
 service in defence of the Reich.  While fast and maneuvrable, it's too small to carry radar, so is only effective
 with searchlight support or on clear moonlit nights.

==Do17Z==

Converted versions of the Dornier Do17Z "Fliegende Bleistift" bomber were among Nazi Germany's first night-
 fighters.  Initially these relied upon searchlight support and infrared equipment.  The Dorniers are slow and not
 very effective.

==Ju88C==

The Junkers Ju88 was to become the backbone of the German night-fighter force.  In every way an improvement over
 the Dornier, it's a stable gun platform and carries airborne radar.

==NEW_Ju88C==

The Germans are bringing a new type of night-fighter into service.  The Junkers Ju88C has the performance to pose
 a real threat to your bombers.

==Bf110==

The Messerschmitt Bf110 "Zerstörer" (Destroyer) was designed as a 'heavy fighter'.  It's well suited to night
 operations and mounts a heavy armament.
However, it's slower than its contemporary, the Ju88, and slightly less maneuvrable.

==NEW_Bf110==

The Germans are bringing a night-fighter variant of the Messerschmitt Bf110 into service.  It's heavily armed.

==Fw190A==

The Focke-Wulf Fw190A is a high-performance, rugged day-fighter, with very heavy armament.  Like all day-fighters,
 it's too small to carry radar, so must rely on "Wilde Sau" tactics.

==NEW_Fw190A==

The Germans are beginning to deploy a new day-fighter, the Focke-Wulf Fw190A.  It's a heavily-armed and rugged
 aircraft and could prove troublesome on moonlit nights.

==Do217J==

The Dornier Do217J is a development of the old Dornier 17.  With more powerful engines and improved avionics, it's
 a cheap-and-cheerful night-fighter, though its capabilities are less than its contemporaries.

==NEW_Do217J==

The Germans are bringing a new type of night-fighter into service.  The Dornier Do217J is an uprated Do17
 development with significant hitting power.

==Bf109G==

The Messerschmitt Bf109G "Gustav" is an enhanced variant of the earlier 109E.
Its greater speed and heavier armament come at the cost of a slight reduction in maneuvrability.

==NEW_Bf109G==

The Germans are bringing a new day-fighter into service.
The Messerschmitt Bf109G is faster than both the Bf109E and the Fw190.

==Me262==

The Messerschmitt Me262 Schwalbe ("Swallow") is a jet-powered fighter.
It's extremely fast, but relatively rare due to production difficulties.

==NEW_Me262==

The Germans are beginning to deploy night-fighter versions of the Me262 jet fighter.
Its very high speed could make it a potent threat.
