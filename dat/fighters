# Cost in £
# Speed in mph (cruising, approx)
# Armament is 'just a number', high is good
# Maneuvrability also just a number (high good), ranges from ~20 for a converted bomber to 100 for a single-seat dogfighter
# Dates are entry/exit from service
# Flags is either DAY or NIGHT.  DAYfighters do not carry radar, and are single-seat.  Nightfighters have a navigator and (if it's been developed) an airborne intercept radar set (which reduces speed by about 30mph), and can be equipped with Schräge Musik
