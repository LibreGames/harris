You have been appointed Commander-in-Chief of RAF Bomber Command.

As experience has shown that precision bombing requires much greater accuracy than appears to be attainable, you
 are now directed to pursue the area bombing of cities.  Your attacks should now be focused upon the morale of the
 enemy civil population, and in particular industrial workers.  You are accordingly authorised to employ your
 forces without restriction.

The Navy have asked you to drop mines in strategic sea lanes; such operations are code-named "Gardening".

Your front-line forces consist of the following types:
Vickers Wellington:
 A rugged and reliable all-rounder, but starting to show its age.
Avro Manchester:
 A disappointing medium bomber, suffering from unreliable engines.
Short Stirling:
 A large but slow heavy bomber, with limited range.
Handley Page Halifax:
 A long-range 'heavy', mainly effective but vulnerable to fighter attack.
Avro Lancaster:
 A brand new heavy bomber, with impressive performance.

The Third Reich is known to be operating the following fighter types:
Messerschmitt Bf109:
 A high-performance day-fighter pressed into interceptor service.
Focke-Wulf Fw190:
 A heavily-armed, rugged day-fighter.
Dornier Do17Z:
 An obsolete nightfighter with limited armament and performance.
Messerschmitt Bf110:
 The Bf109's stablemate is a capable nightfighter with plenty of armament.
Junkers Ju88:
 This nightfighter has remarkable performance and will pose a serious threat.
