Bomber types:
Bristol Blenheim.  Slow, doesn't carry much, poor defence, accuracy rubbish.  However, you start with a fairly large number of them.  (If you start on 3/9/39, that is)
Armstrong-Whitworth Whitley.  Obsolescent: Very slow, moderately low capacity, poor defence, accuracy poor.  However, they make up a large portion of your starting force.
Handley Page Hampden.  Slightly faster than the Blenheim but carries less, also poor defence, accuracy poor.  You start with quite a few of them.
Vickers Wellington.  Still fairly slow, but carries quite a weight and can take a lot of damage; accuracy moderate-poor.  You start with hardly any of them, and early production is limited, but these are worth having if you can get them.
Avro Manchester.  Moderate speed, carries a decent weight, but prone to early returns and losses due to mechanical failure; accuracy moderate-poor.  Available beginning late 1940.  Production takes a long time to ramp up.  [November 1940, 24 February 1941]
Short Stirling.  Slower than the Manchester, carries a greater weight, less failure-prone but not great at defence, accuracy moderate.  Available beginning early 1941. [January 1941, 11 February 1941]
Handley Page Halifax I.  Faster, carries more weight than Manc or Stir, but rather prone to a fatal yaw spiral and crash especially when taking defensive maneuvers; accuracy good.  Available beginning mid 1941  [November 1940, 12 March 1941]
Avro Lancaster I.  Just great: faster than HalI, carries more, better survival; accuracy good.  Available beginning early 1942.  [early 1942]
dH Mosquito: Very fast, carries about as much as a Wlng, great at survival; accuracy very good (partly thanks to longer Oboe etc. range).  Available beginning mid 1942.  [Summer of 1942]
Handley Page Halifax III.  As HalI but without the fatal yaw, and slightly heavier capacity (though still less than LanI); accuracy good.  Cheaper than LanI.  Available beginning early 1943. [1943]
Avro Lancaster X.  The best, but expensive: faster, heavier, better defence; accuracy good.  Available beginning early 1944.

Navaids:
GEE, March 1942: Hyperbolic lattice from ground transmissions; range 350mi, accuracy about 1/200, jamming begins about August 1942 reducing range (eventually) to about 80mi (about Oct '42)
H2S, 30 January 1943: Air-to-ground radar, good fixes on rivers and other bodies of water (including coast crossing, of course).
OBOE, December 1942: Ground-controlled bombing system, accurate to 100yd, range 250mi.  Capacity only about 18 a/c per hour per station, so best used for Pathfinders, especially Mossies
G-H, October 1943: 'inverse OBOE' navigation and bombing system, accuracy and range as OBOE, but can handle about 80 a/c per station

Pathfinders:
Formed in August 1942 (this will be forced on you, whether you like it or not, as historically); your best crews are transferred to the PFF, who mark targets.  Until this point, routes are at individual a/c captains' discretion; from this point on, you lay down routes and Times on Target.  There are lots of ways in which a bomber stream & PFF helps: mutual defence, better accuracy... but it helps the Germans guess where you're going!
