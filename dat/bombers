# Cost in Â£
# Speed in mph (cruising, approx)
# Capacity in lb (approx)
# Serviceability proportion (works up to this value, log)

# Failure represents the chance of mech. fail. crashes and early returns, 'just a number', high is bad
# Accuracy is an approximate percentage loads-on-target for a moderate raid to about the Ruhr...
