==Installing Harris from Windows zipfile==

Assuming you've already unpacked the zipfile (and how else would you have got this file?), there's no installation needed; just double-click on harris.exe
At this point a small grey window with a menu should pop up.  For further help, see the Tutorial in the file 'howtoplay'.
