==beginning==

You have been appointed Commander-in-Chief of RAF Bomber Command.  The Air Ministry have instructed you to employ your forces on attacks upon enemy shipping and upon purely military targets; your crews are under standing orders not to bomb if there is any danger to civilians, and in particular not to drop their bombs without visual identification of the target.

The Air Ministry further reminds you that due to the shortage of industrial capacity, and the lack of trained aircrews, losses must be conserved as much as possible.  Nonetheless you are expected to strike against the enemy with as much force as these restrictions allow.

You are also notified that the Political Warfare department wishes you to drop their propaganda leaflets over Germany whenever you can spare the forces to do so, in order to sow dissent and discontent amongst the German people.

==CIV==

In light of the costs of waging the bomber campaign, and of the enemy's clear indication that he intends to observe no limits to the conduct of war (as demonstrated by recent events), the restrictions upon bombing in civilian areas have been lifted; bombs may be dropped without positive target identification.  However, you are still directed to aim your attacks upon military targets; the War Office does not believe this country should engage in the indiscriminate bombing of civilians.

==ABD==

As experience has shown that precision bombing requires much greater accuracy than appears to be attainable, you are now directed to pursue the area bombing of cities.  Your attacks should now be focused upon the morale of the enemy civil population, and in particular industrial workers.  You are accordingly authorized to employ your forces without restriction.

==Blenheim==

The twin-engined Bristol Blenheim (Bristol Type 142M) was, when introduced in 1937, as fast as contemporary fighters.  By the outbreak of war, however, it had already been outclassed by the rapid pace of aeronautical development.  This, combined with its poor defensive armament, leave it vulnerable to fighter attack.  As a light bomber, it carries a mere 1,200lb of bombs, and hasn't the range to attack distant targets.  It's best employed against coastal targets and enemy-held airfields and troop concentrations in France.

==Whitley==

The Armstrong Whitworth A.W.38 Whitley is a twin-engined medium bomber, designed for night operations.  Due to the high angle of incidence of the wings (to ensure good takeoff performance), the Whitley flies with a nose-down attitude; the resulting high drag makes it rather slow.  However, it can carry a bomb load of about 7,000lb, the heaviest of the bombers available to you at the start of the war.  It's best used on shortish-range night attacks and leaflet raids.

==Hampden==

The Handley Page HP.52 Hampden was conceived as a fast, manoeuvrable, "fighting bomber".  It's a twin-engined medium bomber, and the fastest of the bombers available in 1939.  Its bomb load of 4,000lb is lighter than the other medium bombers, and it's fairly vulnerable to modern fighters.
