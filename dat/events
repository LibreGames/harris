# Format is ID:DD-MM-YYYY
# Remarks.
# For many of these events, only the month or even "early/late 19xx" are known or meaningful.
# The overly precise dates for things like the introduction of Tame Boar (Zahme Sau) tactics, or the Battle of the Barges, are there purely for gameplay reasons.
# It is of course unrealistic to have, for example, the German defences switch en masse from Himmelbett zones to Zahme Sau on a particular day; it's merely a simplification that makes both the game and its implementation less complicated.  Such things may be made more gradual later, but in the meantime the precise dates are thoroughly arbitrary.
# The dates of things like navaids, RCM devices and German radars are currently a confusion; some of them refer to the first Service use of the device, others to when production became sufficiently great that it was available in meaningful quantity.
