fighter methods

start-KAMMHUBER:
Fighters are deployed to cover targets that seem threatened.

KAMMHUBER-TAMEBOAR:
Fighters are deployed to /Himmelbett/ zones and other sited Würzburgs.

TAMEBOAR-end:
Nightfighters are deployed to where the bomber stream is headed and subsequently rely on airborne radar.  Dayfighters use Wild Boar (cover targets that seem threatened).


idea - achievements
Certain things, when achieved, have a propaganda value, and can consequently be used to argue for more bombers.  For instance: the first hundred-bomber raid; the first thousand-bomber raid; the first bombload to fall on the German mainland; the first bombload to fall on Berlin; the first target to be destroyed; the first city to be destroyed.  Each of these achievements should trigger an increase in the budget.


new pff system:
PFF Lancs always just drop flares and incendiary-heavy loads; typically a Finder load of up to 14 SBCs and (if equipped with H₂S) a single 'skymarker' release-point flare.
Mossies may be set to drop markers (TIs etc.) or a single 'cookie' (this is more LNSF style) - all Mossies on a given target are set together (due to UI limitations).
Main force Lancs drop a mostly HE load.  For instance a typical Berlin load might be one 4,000lb 'cookie', 6 × 500lb GP, and 3 SBCs (1000lb ea.) with 4lb or 30lb incendiaries; total 10,000lb.
Main force Halifaxes carry a higher proportion of incendiaries; up to 12 SBCs and 3 × 500lb GP.  For Berlin the number of SBCs would probably be 8, for a total of 9,500lb.
For now we're not going to model the loads in quite that detail, just a balance of incendiaries vs. HE.  Also, the Main force settings are defaults; the following bombloads are available for Main Force bombers:
	Abnormal - full HE
		500lb or 1000lb GP/HE up to a/c weight limit (eg Wlng 9×500, Lanc 14×1000, Hal3 9×1000+9×500).  Also available for Mosq as 4×1000lb GP/HE
	Plumduff-Plus - HE/HC - Manchester/Lancaster only
		8000lb HC, 6×500lb GP/HE
	Plumduff - blast, demolition and fire (except Stirlings, which can't carry a cookie)
		4000lb HC, up to 3×1000lb (or 500lb) GP/HE, SBCs or incendiaries (eg Wlng 4000+12×30i, Lanc 4000+3×1000+6SBC, Hal3 4000+3×500+6SBC)
	Usual - blast and max. incendiary
		4000lb HC or small GP, SBC up to a/c limit (eg Lanc 4000+10SBC, Hal3 3×500+12SBC)
	Arson - full incendiary
		SBCs up to a/c limit (eg Wlng 4SBC+12×30i, Lanc 14SBC, Hal3 13SBC+12×30i)

PFF Opener: "Usual" + 1× release-point flare.  If no H₂S fall back to Usual
PFF Finder: "Arson" + 1× release-point flare.  If no H₂S fall back to Arson
PFF Illuminator (Mosq): 12×250lb coloured TI + (if target within Oboe range) 1× release-point flare
PFF Backer-Up: as Opener (heavy) or Illuminator (Mosq), except that navaids are not required

Bombload rules for now (distillation of the above):
	Abnormal, Plumduff-Plus: 100% HE
	Plumduff: 4000lb HE, up to 6000lb IN (8000lb for Hal3), rest HE
	Usual: 4000lb HE if cap>=14000 else 1500lb HE; rest IN
	Arson: 100% IN
	Illuminator: 3000lb TI


industry tracking:
Industry target flags (already in) are: BB, OIL, RAIL, UBOOT, AC, ARM, STEEL
Fighter production depends on AC and BB; fuel supplies should also be tracked and depend on OIL.
Flak strength should depend on ARM and STEEL.
RAIL should scale all production.
UBOOT doesn't affect the defences, but it makes the War Office happy.
A city with no type flag contributes equally to all seven types.
