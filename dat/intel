==Schillig Roads==
The approaches to the Weser ports, passing the islands of Langeoog and Wangerooge, are a focal point for German
 merchant shipping.  They are named after the nearby village Schillig in Niedersachsen.

==Heligoland Bight==
As the Germans have yet to institute a convoy system, individual merchant ships can frequently be found in this
 bay, including much of the sea traffic from Hamburg and the Elbe, as well as the Weser ports.  It should be a
 profitable destination for so-called 'armed reconnaisance' flights.

==Wilhelmshaven Docks==
The port of Wilhelmshaven on the shore of the Jadebusen is a busy shipping terminal.  It also contains shipyards
 key to the Kriegsmarine fleet; the Admiral Graf Spee, for example, was built and launched here.
Consequently, both military and commercial vessels can often be found and attacked here.  However, the Germans are
 well aware of the inviting target it presents and have defended it with heavy flak.

==Hörnum, Sylt==
The naval air station at Hörnum, on the isle of Sylt in Schleswig-Holstein, is used as a base for the forces,
 mainly Dorniers, covering the Heligoland region.

==Norway Fleet==
This Kriegsmarine task force is steaming north for the invasion of Norway, and is beyond the range of land-based
 fighter cover.  However, several of the warships mount fairly heavy anti-aircraft guns.
It will remain within range of your bombers until the last week of April.

==Kiel Dockyards==
The base of the Baltic fleet of the Kriegsmarine, the shipyards of Kiel are home to many German warships.  Their
 importance has led the Germans to protect them with heavy flak.

==Channel Dash==
The battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, the cruiser Prinz Eugen, and their escorts have left Brest, and are
 steaming at full speed up the English Channel.  We have been caught off guard and will only have time for one
 attack before they reach their bases.

==Berlin==
The German capital is a sprawling modern city of over 4 million inhabitants.  It is a major rail hub, and lies on
 the Spree and Havel rivers.  Major industries include U-boats, electrical cables, and electronics; many German
 radar sets are manufactured here.
Due to its modern construction, the city is unlikely to burn well; there is no wooden Altstadt in which to start
 a conflagration.  We will have to destroy it the hard way, with high explosive 'cookies' and 500-pounders.
Berlin's flak defences are strong and well-trained, and the Luftwaffe always keeps a defensive force close by.
While much of the flight to Berlin can be routed over the North Sea, there is still a long stretch over Schleswig-
 Holstein and Brandenburg.  In particular the bombers must be routed around Hamburg and Bremen, both well
 defended.  Alternatively, a more northerly route via the Baltic Sea and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern can avoid the
 strongest defences, at the cost of a longer flight and thus smaller bomb loads.

==Hamburg==
The city of Hamburg, on the Elbe, is a major port city.  It contains large oil works, and the Blohm und Voss
 shipyards and aircraft factory.  Hamburg is also a major financial and banking centre.
Hamburg's port is used mainly for merchant shipping, but it is also a launching point for many U-boats headed for
 the North Sea and Atlantic.
Its large size and accessible location (it is only 70 miles from the North Sea coast) have led the Wehrmacht to
 install fairly strong anti-aircraft defences.  It lies within the region covered by the 2nd Fighter Division.

==Hamburg Leaflets==

==Frankfurt==
Frankfurt am Main, in Hesse, is a commercial city of around half a million inhabitants.  It is also the financial
 centre of the Rhine-Ruhr-Main region.  However, its most important war industries are the IG Farben chemical
 works, which supply a substantial fraction of the Wehrmacht's explosives, and the VKF ball-bearing works.
The Altstadt is expected to burn effectively, and the city's industry is well-concentrated.  Navigation in the
 region is helped by clear ground features including the River Main.
Its location to the south-east of the Ruhr means that it is difficult to reach without crossing the defences of
 that industrial heartland.  Its own defences, by comparison, are mediocre.

==Frankfurt Leaflets==

==Munich==
Deep in Bavaria, Munich is one of the most distant targets in Germany.  As the original home of the Nazi party,
 it has considerable political significance.  Industrially, it contains major Siemens electrical works, BMW,
 and the truck manufacturer MAN.  It has a population of around 800,000.
Munich's rail yards are a transportation hub for much of Bavaria, as well as Germany's gateway to Central Europe.
The defences of Munich are very strong; while lacking in fighter cover, there are a great many Flak guns in and
 around the city.  This, combined with its location, makes it a difficult target to attack.

==Munich Leaflets==

==Cologne==
Astride the river Rhine, the city of Cologne has three-quarters of a million inhabitants.  Its industries include
 oil refineries and automotive engineering.  The airport at Butzweilerhof is second in importance only to Berlin
 Tempelhof.
Cologne is also a major military headquarters, responsible for much of the Rheinland.
Flak defences in Cologne are only moderate; it relies mainly on fighters for protection.

==Cologne Leaflets==

==Essen==
The industrial city of Essen in the Ruhr valley is home to the Krupps armament works, as well as coal mining and
 iron and steel production.  Overall the city can be characterised as 'heavy industry'.  There is a permanent
 industrial haze or smog over the city, which may make target finding difficult.
Essen is protected by a large contingent of Flak guns from its own factories, both within the city and around it
 to cover various approaches.

==Essen Leaflets==

==Dusseldorf==
Dusseldorf is an industrial city on the banks of the Rhine.  It contains extensive steelworks, as well as an oil
 refinery and minor automotive factories.  Mostly its production is in raw materials which feed the heavy industry
 of the Ruhr valley.
The defences of Dusseldorf are surprisingly weak, though the surrounding area does contain quite a lot of
 scattered Flak.

==Peenemünde==
The German Army and Luftwaffe are developing secret weapons at Peenemünde on the Baltic coast.  The FZG76 is a
 pilotless 'flying bomb', and the Aggregat 4 is a long range rocket.  These weapons, if successfully deployed
 against London, could cause a great deal of damage, perhaps worse than the Blitz.
