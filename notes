idea - achievements
Certain things, when achieved, have a propaganda value, and can consequently be used to argue for more bombers.  For instance: the first hundred-bomber raid; the first thousand-bomber raid; the first bombload to fall on the German mainland; the first bombload to fall on Berlin; the first target to be destroyed; the first city to be destroyed.  Each of these achievements should trigger an increase in the budget.
